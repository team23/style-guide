### Breaking Changes

#### Updated ESLint version to 9.0.0

- The minimum required version of ESLint has been updated from `^8.0.0` to `^9.9.0`. This is a significant update
  that does require making changes to accommodate the new linting rules and features provided by ESLint 9.x.
- A key feature introduced in ESLint 9.x is the required use
  [of the new Flat Config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files).
  Flat Config is a modern and streamlined approach to configuring ESLint, replacing the traditional `.eslintrc`
  configuration files.
- If you do want to know how to use this library with Flat Config, checkout its [README.md](README.md).

#### Changes to rules

- The upgrade to ESLint 9.x and associated plugins brought about changes in several existing rules.
  Some rules have been deprecated, modified, or replaced with more up-to-date equivalents.
  These changes reflect the latest developments in TypeScript standards and best practices, and may require you to
  adjust your code to meet the new requirements.

### Changes

- Updated the repository URL and structure to reflect the new project structure within a monorepo
  at `https://github.com/team23/style-guide.git` under the `libs/angular` directory.
- Updated `homepage` URL to `https://github.com/team23/style-guide/libs/angular`.
- Enhanced the keywords in `package.json` to improve discoverability. New keywords
  include `"eslint-config"` and `"angular"`.
- The license and documentation files have been explicitly listed in the `files` field
  to ensure they are included in the published package.
- The package now uses an `exports` field to define the entry points for different
  module formats (`import`, `require`, `types`). This change might affect how the package is consumed in different
  environments.
- `tsc-multi` was introduced to support usage in ESM and CommonJS projects.
- The `files` field in `package.json` has been defined to include only the necessary files in the
  npm package, improving the package's footprint.
- `typescript-eslint` has been introduced as a dependency for type-safe rule configuration.
